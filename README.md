# odin-recipes
In this project I am going to practice all of the HTML knowledge I have acquired.
I am building a basic recipe website.

The skills I will will demonstrate are:
    Boilerplate HTML
    Writing content for the website
    Adding images to the website with HTML
    Adding links both internal and external links
