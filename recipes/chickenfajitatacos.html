                <li>11/2 green bell pepper, seeded and cut into strips</li>  
                <li>1/2 red bell pepper, seeded and cut into strips</li>
                <li>8 (6 inch) flour tortillas</li>
                <li>1 avocado, pitted and sliced, or as needed</li>
                <li>1/2 cup sour cream, or as needed</li>
                <li>1 1/2 cups water</li>
                <li>1/2 cup crumbled cotija cheese, or as needed</li> 
            </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Steps:</strong><br>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine orange juice, taco seasoning, and vegetable oil in a large resealable bag. Add chicken, coat with the marinade, 
            squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator overnight.</li>
        
            <li>Heat a cast iron skillet over medium high heat.</li>
            
            <li>Cook chicken in the hot skillet for 5 minutes. Add onion, green bell pepper, and red bell pepper. 
            Cook until peppers are crisp tender, 4 to 5 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into center of chicken strips should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        
            <li>Heat tortillas until soft and pliable. Top with chicken fajita mixture, avocado, sour cream, and cotija cheese. Serve immediately.</li>
